**CINNAMON DOUGHNUTS:**
*STEP-BY-STEP RECIPE:*
1. Combine flour, sugar, yeast and salt in a bowl. Mix in milk, butter and egg along with it until the dough comes together.
2. Knead on a well-floured surface until it becomes smooth. Place in a greased bowl. Cover and keep for 1 and 1/2 hours.
3. Knead on a lightly-floured surface for 2 minutes or until smooth. Rest the dough for 2 minutes. 
4. Use a cutter to cut out the discs. Place on a tray, and set aside for 15 minutes to rise slightly.
5. Combine extra sugar and cinnamon on a tray. Heat the oil to 180 degrees Celsius. Deep-fry 4-5 doughnuts for 40 seconds on each side or until puffed and golden. 
6. Transfer the doughnuts to the sugar mixture and turn to coat. Repeat this in 3 more batches with the remaining doughnuts. 
7. You can now eat the doughnuts :)
